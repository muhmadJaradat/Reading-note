# Spring Authentication 

## Spring Security Architecture

* a tutrial aims to walk me throught security in spring mvc.

#### Authentication and Access Control

* solve two problems.

* authentication is who are you.

* authorization is what are you allowed to do.

* spring seperate who from what.

* **Spring Security** a framework that seperate authentication from authorization .

  * extension points to both.

#### 

* `AuthenticationManager` has one method.

```java
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

* An `AuthenticationManager` has method `authenticate(Authentication authentication)`

  * it return `Authentication`  or `AuthenticationException`.

* The **Class<?>** argument in the supports() method is really Class<? extends Authentication> (it is only ever asked if it supports something that is passed into the authenticate() method). A ProviderManager can support multiple different authentication mechanisms in the same application by delegating to a chain of AuthenticationProviders. If a ProviderManager does not recognize a particular Authentication instance type, it is skipped. 

* A ProviderManager has an optional parent, which it can consult if all providers return null. If the parent is not available, a null Authentication results in an AuthenticationException.

Sometimes, an application has logical groups of protected resources (for example, all web resources that match a path pattern, such as /api/**), and each group can have its own dedicated AuthenticationManager. Often, each of those is a ProviderManager, and they share a parent. The parent is then a kind of “global” resource, acting as a fallback for all providers.

#### Customizing Authentication Manager

* Spring Security provides configs helpers to easily get authentication manager features set up in my application.

#### Authorization or Access Control

- when authentication is successful, I can move on to authorization.

- and the core strategy here is `AccessDecisionManager.`.

  - There are three implementations provided: 

  - 
  
- the three delegate to a chain of `AccessDecisionVoter` instances.

#### Web Security

* Spring Security in the web tier based on Servlet Filters.

* Filters layer : 

![filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/top-spring-security-architecture/master/images/filters.png)

* when client send a request to the app, which filter and which servlet apply will be based on url request path.

* In a Spring Boot application, the security filter is a `@Bean` in the `ApplicationContext`, and it is installed by default so that it is applied to every request.

* Spring Security is a single filter, but, inside of it, there are additional filters.

#### Request Matching for Dispatch and Authorization

* A security filter chain has a request matcher  used to apply it to an HTTP request.

* when a filter chain is applied, no others are applied.

#### Combining Application Security Rules with Actuator Rules

* the Actuator is for manage endpoints and it's configured by default.

* when we add actuator, there are additional filters gets applied to that actuator.

#### Method Security

* Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method.

#### Working with Threads

* Spring Security  needs to make the current authenticated available to a variety of consumers.

* it's useful to write a custom authentication filter.
